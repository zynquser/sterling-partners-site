## Step-by-step: get this on a live URL

### 1. Run it locally first (5 minutes)

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:4321>. The page should look exactly like the production build.

> Need Node.js? Install **Node 20 or newer** from <https://nodejs.org>.

To produce the production build: `npm run build` (output goes to `dist/`).

### 2. Push to GitHub (10 minutes)

1. Go to <https://github.com/new> and create a new **private** (or public) repo named e.g. `sterling-partners-site`. **Do not** initialize it with a README, license, or .gitignore — this folder already has them.
2. In the terminal, from inside this folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Sterling & Partners landing page"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/sterling-partners-site.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Refresh your repo page on GitHub — every file should now be there.

### 3. Deploy on Netlify (5 minutes)

1. Sign in at <https://app.netlify.com>.
2. Click **Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub**.
3. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account if prompted, then pick `sterling-partners-site`.
4. Netlify will auto-detect the `netlify.toml` in this repo. The values should already be filled in:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - **Node version:** `20`
5. Click **Deploy site**. The first build takes ~60 seconds. When it's green, click **Open production deploy** to see it live.

You'll get a free `*.netlify.app` URL immediately. To use a custom domain (e.g., `sterling-partners.com`):

- Netlify dashboard → **Domain settings → Add a domain you already own** → follow the DNS instructions.
- HTTPS is provisioned automatically by Let's Encrypt.

### 4. Future updates — the workflow

```bash
# edit a markdown file or component
git add .
git commit -m "Update Margaret's bio"
git push
```

Netlify watches the `main` branch and rebuilds + redeploys on every push. Usually live within 90 seconds.

### 5. The contact form just works

The Contact form in `src/components/Contact.astro` uses Netlify Forms — submissions go straight to your Netlify dashboard under **Forms**. No backend or third-party service needed.

To get email notifications: Netlify dashboard → **Forms → Settings → Form notifications → Add notification**.

## Replacing the placeholder firm
